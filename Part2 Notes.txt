Learning Steps:
    - Found a bug - Write code when a new bug is found.
    - Modifying code - Write tests when your code is going go be modified.
    - Writing new code - Write tests while adding new code.
    - TDD - Write tests before any code is written.

Effective Testing Cycle:
    - Don't fix the bug right away - Write a test for how the method should behave.
    - Execute test: fails
    - Fix code
    - Execute test: passes
